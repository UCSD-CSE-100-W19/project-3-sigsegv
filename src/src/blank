Say we have "Hello world"
start from end of string
have a pointer at end
decrement pointer until i have a space
have a second pointer at end
use substring method and append it to a new string
on new string, manually add space
move second pointer to where is first pointer
and use substring again

dont add an if statement if it only executes once
